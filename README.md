# Analysis of ESCO Job Skills using TD-IDF and Clustering
## Goal
Skill transferability is an important aspect for people trying to switch jobs or occupations. This project seeks to predict skill reuse levels (cross-sector, occupation-specific, sector-specific, and transversal) and skill type (knowledge vs skill/competence) solely from descriptions. This could be an interesting task, as lists of skills are often included in job advertisements, and reuse level or skill type could provide important insights into how many potential candidates are available in the job market.

## Data
ESCO (European Skills, Competences, Qualifications and Occupations) is a dataset connecting job skills to occupations and competences. It contains approximately 3,000 occupations and 14,000 skills relevant to the occupations in the database. In this project, we will focus on skills. The data enables text analysis of skills, as each skill includes a detailed description.
